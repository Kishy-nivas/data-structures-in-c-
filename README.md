Data structures in c++ 


The main motive of this branch is to have a simple c++ programs to implement various data structures 
I started this repo to avoid scary looking c++ code and make it easy to learn c++ via data structures , 
but after writing a simple linked list, it does look scary, so create a issue if you cannot understand or if things didn't work !
